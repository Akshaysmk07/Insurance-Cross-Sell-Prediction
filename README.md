# 🚗 Health Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction

**Predict which health insurance customers are likely to purchase vehicle insurance using machine learning.**

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The client is a leading insurance company offering Health Insurance. Now, they plan to cross-sell **Vehicle Insurance** to existing customers.  
They require a predictive model that can determine **whether a customer from the past year is likely to be interested in Vehicle Insurance**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

Building a reliable prediction model serves multiple business purposes:

- 🎯 **Targeted Campaigns** – Focus marketing efforts on high-potential customers.
- 💡 **Improved ROI** – Optimize conversion rates and reduce customer acquisition costs.
- 📊 **Data-Driven Strategy** – Make strategic decisions based on predictive insights.
- 💰 **Revenue Growth** – Increase cross-sell opportunities and customer lifetime value.
